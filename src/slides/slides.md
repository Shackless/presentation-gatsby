---

## Since late 2000s: Dynamic Websites

---

## Wordpress

- Powering **33% of the web**
- Almost 50% of these sites are hosted on wordpress.com
- wordpress.com has 142M unique visits per month

## Downsides

- Resources: Webservers, FTPs, Databases
- Less than 1/3 are updated to the latest version
- Many sites are abandoned

## Why Gatsby is great

- Performance!
- PWA out-of-the-box
- Starters (& soon themes)
- Lots of plugins for data sources, e.g. Wordpress
  - Fully progressive & responsive image component
  - Markdown & MDX
  - Headless CMS, e.g. netlify-cms or Contentful
- Documentation

---

## JAMstack & Gatsby in a nutshell

- Write content in React/JS/HTML or MDX ðŸ’–
- Push changes to remote git repository
- Everything else can be automated
  - Build site using a static site generator (Gatsby)
  - Deploy to CDN hoster (Netlify)
- Site is live!

---

## Advantages

- Performance
  - Everything is precompiled and handled client-side
  - CDNs serve pages faster than dynamic webservers
- Security
  - No database or webserver required
  - Literally nothing to attack
- Developer-friendly
  - Just work with git
  - Building & deployment are decoupled & automated
  - CDN takes care of cache invalidation
  - External authoring with headless CMS is possible

---

## Disadvantages

- Every change requires a new build
- Not suited for every web application
  - Complex SPAs
  - Sites relying heavily on access control
