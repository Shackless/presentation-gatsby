## Wordpress

- Powering **33% of the web**
- Almost 50% of these sites are hosted on wordpress.com
- wordpress.com has 142M unique visits per month


- Resources: Webservers, FTPs, Databases
- Less than 1/3 are updated to the latest version
- Many sites are abandoned

## Workflow

---

## What is our static site?

- JavaScript: Basically React & NodeJS (Gatsby)
- APIs: Allowed but NOT treated as part of our site (e.g. Google Geolocation, Twitter API etc.)
  - GraphQL queries at build-time for content (Markdown, posts, images...)
- Markup: Generated HTML5

**Everything gets precompiled!**

---

## JAMstack & Gatsby in a nutshell

- Write posts & pages - in React/HTML or MDX ðŸ’–
- Push changes to remote git repository
- Everything else can be automated
  - Build site using a static site generator (Gatsby)
  - Deploy to CDN hoster (Netlify)
- Site is live!

  - Literally nothing to attack
- Developer-friendly
  - Just work with git
  - Building & deployment are decoupled & automated
  - CDN takes care of cache invalidation
  - External authoring with headless CMS is possible

---

## Disadvantages

- Every change requires a new build
- Not suited for every web application
  - complex SPAs
  - Sites relying heavily on access control

---

## That's it
